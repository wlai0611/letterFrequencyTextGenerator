 The text generator uses probabilites (gram1prob.csv,gram2prob.csv,gram3prob.csv) from a probability chart that was precomputed and is imported
 during the function call.  
 
 The Python Code to create gram2prob.csv was taken from Nick Brosowsky's commit written in R code to Entropy Typing:
  https://github.com/CrumpLab/EntropyTyping/pull/22
  
  The letter frequencies used to calculate the probability charts was taken from Peter Norvig's website: https://norvig.com/mayzner.html

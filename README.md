# letterFrequencyTextGenerator 
PLEASE SEE AUTHOR PAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTED

Will generate text that uses each letter's and letter combo's frequency in the English language.
The program starts by creating a text in which letters are randomly typed which gives equal probability to all letters.
Then the program types letters that are sensitive to single letter probabilities (Unigrams),
letter pair probabilities (Bigrams), and letter trio probabilities (Trigrams).

For example for Unigram Frequencies: 
There will be a lot of E's because they are used so much in the English language.
For example for Bigram Frequencies: 
There will be a lot of QU's and AN's because they are so commonly together in English language.
For example for Trigram Frequencies:
There will be a lot of ING's, ION's and QUE's because they are so commonly together in English language.
